# Clearf

> [!Note]
Only works in **POSIX** systems, or at least in linux, as it gets keystrokes data directly from the driver

Inspired by [this project](https://github.com/tsoding/voidf), i decided to make my own (much simpler but it still works ig), and i decided to use my most used command in the last month for it: 

```bash
> zhs_stats

     1  2142  21.3517%   clear
     2  1538  15.3309%   nvim
     3  945   9.41986%   ls
     4  530   5.28309%   cd
     5  315   3.13995%   git
     6  250   2.49203%   sudo
     7  238   2.37241%   rm
     8  140   1.39553%   cat
     9  121   1.20614%   yay
    10  108   1.07656%   waybar
    11  77    0.767544%  l
    12  77    0.767544%  dec
    13  71    0.707735%  cp
    14  69    0.687799%  python
    15  65    0.647927%  mv
    16  64    0.637959%  mkdir
    17  64    0.637959%  cargo
    18  62    0.618022%  enc
    19  53    0.528309%  gcc
    20  51    0.508373%  gobuster
```
## To run it: 
Make sure you have raylib installed as well as the gcc compiler, then change the script _run.sh_ to fit your own, then run it like this: 
```bash
chmod +x ./run.sh && ./run.sh
```
