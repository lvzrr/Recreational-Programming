# KeyWatcher

A multithreaded daemon to display keystrokes through the keyboard using raylib (Only works on **POSIX** operating systems, or at least in Linux)

> [!Warning]
I'm currently working on it, it can't display certain symbols yet (basically because of raylib's shitty UTF-8 render implementation)

## To run it
Ensure gcc and raylib are installed and change the paths in run.sh, then: 
```bash 
chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh
```
> [!Note] 
I wouldn't change the font, bc i adjusted the buffer so it has 1 more char than the display, but you do you
